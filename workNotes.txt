sales are about
working hard
having a keeping a great and positive attitude
look for bright side; if you could make it thru a bad day, you can do great on easy days
respect everyone, otherwise youll lose
prepare so you can be productive
be on time, people are only late to things that arent important to them, no one is late to their wedding
make it important, its about respect
work a full day, make sure we have our time ready to spend
increase law of averages by upping conversations
understand the oppurunity, if you understand the product and everything else you will be more equipped
take control in the field, its black and white
